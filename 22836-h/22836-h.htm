    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m desperately afear&rsquo;d, Sue, that that brother of thine will turn out a
      jackanapes,&rdquo; was the apostrophe of the good yeoman Michael Howe, to his
      pretty daughter Susan, as they were walking one fine afternoon in harvest
      through some narrow and richly wooded lanes, which wound between the
      crofts of his farm of Rutherford West, situate in that out-of-the-way part
      of Berkshire which is emphatically called &ldquo;the Low Country,&rdquo; for no better
      reason that I can discover than that it is the very hilliest part of the
      royal county. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sadly afear&rsquo;d, Sue, that he&rsquo;ll turn out a jackanapes!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      the stout farmer brandished the tall paddle which served him at once as a
      walking stick and a weeding-hook, and began vigorously eradicating the
      huge thistles which grew by the roadside, as a mere vent for his vexation.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see that he&rsquo;ll come back an arrant puppy,&rdquo; quoth Michael Howe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father! don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; rejoined Susan, &ldquo;why should you think so
      hardly of poor William&mdash;our own dear William, whom we have not seen
      these three years? What earthly harm has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm, girl! Look at his letters! You know you&rsquo;re ashamed yourself to take
      &lsquo;em of the postman. Pink paper, forsooth, and blue ink, and a seal with
      bits of make-believe gold speckled about in it like a ladybird&rsquo;s wings&mdash;I
      hate all make-believes, all shams; they&rsquo;re worse than poison;&mdash;and
      stinking of some outlandish scent, so that I&rsquo;m forced to smoke a couple of
      pipes extra to get rid of the smell; and latterly, as if this folly was
      not enough, he has crammed these precious scrawls into a sort of
      paper-bag, pasted together just as if o&rsquo; purpose to make us pay double
      postage. Jackanapes did I call him? He&rsquo;s a worse mollycot than a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, all young men will be foolish one way or another; and you
      know my uncle says, that William is wonderfully steady for so young a man,
      and his master is so well pleased with him, that he is now foreman in his
      great concern. You must pardon a little nonsense in a country youth,
      thrown suddenly into a fine shop in the gayest part of London, and with
      his godfather&rsquo;s legacy coming unexpectedly upon him, and making him too
      rich for a journeyman tradesman. But he&rsquo;s coming to see us now. He would
      have come six months ago, as soon as he got this money, if his master
      could have spared him; and he&rsquo;ll be wiser before he goes back to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he. Hang Lunnon! Why did he go to Lunnon at all? Why could not he
      stop at Rutherford like his father and his father&rsquo;s father, and see to the
      farm? What business had he in a great shop?&mdash;a man-mercer&rsquo;s they call
      it. What call had he to Lunnon, I say? Tell me that, Miss Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear father, you know very well that when Master George Arnot was so
      unluckily obstinate about the affair of the water-course, and would go to
      law with you, and swore that instead of marrying William, poor Mary should
      be married to the rich maltster old Jacob Giles, William, who had loved
      Mary ever since they were children together, could not bear to stay in the
      country, and went off to my uncle, forbidding me ever to mention her name
      in a letter; and,&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo; rejoined the father, somewhat
      softened, &ldquo;but he need not have turned puppy and coxcomb because he was
      crossed in love. Pshaw!&rdquo; added the good farmer, giving a mighty tug with
      his paddle at a tough mullein which happened to stand in his way, &ldquo;I was
      crossed in love myself, in my young days, but I did not run off and turn
      tailor. I made up plump to another wench&mdash;your poor mother, Susan,
      that&rsquo;s dead and gone&mdash;and carried her off like a man; married her in
      a month, girl; and that&rsquo;s what Will should have done. I&rsquo;m afear&rsquo;d we shall
      find him a sad jackanapes. Jem Hathaway, the gauger, told me last
      market-day that he saw him one Sunday in the what-dye-call&rsquo;t&mdash;the
      Park there, covered with rings, and gold chains, and fine velvets&mdash;all
      green and gold, like our great peacock. Well! we shall soon see. He comes
      to-night, you say? &lsquo;Tis not above six o&rsquo;clock by the sun, and the Wantage
      coach don&rsquo;t come in till seven. Even if they lend him a horse and cart at
      the Nag&rsquo;s Head, he can&rsquo;t be here these two hours. So I shall just see the
      ten acre field cleared, and be home time enough to shake him by the hand
      if he comes like a man, or to kick him out of doors if he looks like a
      dandy.&rdquo; And off strode the stout yeoman in his clouted shoes, his leather
      gaiters, and smockfrock, and a beard (it was Friday) of six days&rsquo; growth;
      looking altogether prodigiously like a man who would keep his word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan, on her part, continued to thread the narrow winding lanes that led
      towards Wantage; walking leisurely along, and forming as she went, half
      unconsciously, a nosegay of the wild flowers of the season; the delicate
      hare-bell, the lingering wood-vetch, the blue scabious, the heaths which
      clustered on the bank, the tall graceful lilac campanula, the snowy bells
      of the bindweed, the latest briar-rose, and that species of clematis,
      which, perhaps, because it generally indicates the neighbourhood of
      houses, has won for itself the pretty name of the traveller&rsquo;s joy, whilst
      that loveliest of wild flowers, whose name is now sentimentalised out of
      prettiness, the intensely blue forget-me-not, was there in rich profusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan herself was not unlike her posy; sweet and delicate, and full of a
      certain pastoral grace. Her light and airy figure suited well with a fair
      mild countenance, breaking into blushes and smiles when she spoke, and set
      off by bright ringlets of golden hair, parted on her white forehead, and
      hanging in long curls on her finely-rounded cheeks. Always neat but never
      fine, gentle, cheerful, and modest, it would be difficult to find a
      prettier specimen of an English farmer&rsquo;s daughter than Susan Howe. But
      just now the little damsel wore a look of care not usual to her fair and
      tranquil features; she seemed, as she was, full of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor William!&rdquo; so ran her thoughts, &ldquo;my father would not even listen to
      his last letter because it poisoned him with musk. I wonder that William
      can like that disagreeable smell! and he expects him to come down on the
      top of the coach, instead of which, he says that he means to purchase a&mdash;a&mdash;(even
      in her thoughts poor Susan could not master the word, and was obliged to
      have recourse to the musk-scented billet) britschka&mdash;ay, that&rsquo;s it!&mdash;or
      a droschky; I wonder what sort of things they are&mdash;and that he only
      visits us <i>en passant</i> in a tour, for which, town being so empty, and
      business slack, his employer has given him leave, and in which he is to be
      accompanied by his friend Monsieur Victor&mdash;Victor&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make
      out his other name&mdash;an eminent perfumer who lives next door. To think
      of bringing a Frenchman here, remembering how my father hates the whole
      nation! Oh dear, dear! And yet I know William. I know why he went, and I
      do believe, in spite of a little finery and foolishness, and of all the
      britschkas, and droschkies, and Victors, into the bargain, that he&rsquo;ll be
      glad to get home again. No place like home! Even in these silly notes that
      feeling is always at the bottom. Did not I hear a carriage before me? Yes!&mdash;no!&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t tell. One takes every thing for the sound of wheels when one is
      expecting a dear friend!&mdash;And if we can but get him to look, as he
      used to look, and to be what he used to be, he won&rsquo;t leave us again for
      all the fine shops in Regent Street, or all the britschkas and droschkies
      in Christendom. My father is getting old now, and William ought to stay at
      home,&rdquo; thought the affectionate sister; &ldquo;and I firmly believe that what he
      ought to do, he will do. Besides which&mdash;surely there <i>is</i> a
      carriage now.&rdquo; Just as Susan arrived at this point of her cogitations,
      that sound which had haunted her imagination all the afternoon, the sound
      of wheels rapidly advancing, became more and more audible, and was
      suddenly succeeded by a tremendous crash, mixed with men&rsquo;s voices&mdash;one
      of them her brother&rsquo;s&mdash;venting in two languages (for Monsieur Victor,
      whatever might be his proficiency in English, had recourse in this
      emergency to his native tongue) the different ejaculations of anger and
      astonishment which are pretty sure to accompany an overset: and on turning
      a corner of the lane, Susan caught her first sight of the britschka or
      droschky, whichever it might be, that had so much puzzled her simple
      apprehension, in the shape of a heavy-looking open carriage garnished with
      head and apron, lying prostrate against a gate-post, of which the wheels
      had fallen foul. Her brother was fully occupied in disengaging the horses
      from the traces, in reprimanding his companion for his bad driving, which
      he declared had occasioned the accident, and in directing him to go for
      assistance to a cottage half a mile back on the road to Wantage, whilst he
      himself intimated his intention of proceeding for more help to the Farm;
      and the obedient Frenchman&mdash;who, notwithstanding the derangement
      which his coëffure might naturally be expected to have experienced in his
      tumble, looked, Susan thought, as if his hair were put in paper every
      night and pomatumed every morning, and as if his whole dapper person were
      saturated with his own finest essences, a sort of travelling perfumer&rsquo;s
      shop, a peripatetic pouncet-box&mdash;walked off in the direction
      indicated, with an air of habitual submission, which showed pretty plainly
      that, whether as proprietor of the unlucky britschka, or from his own
      force of character, William was considered as the principal director of
      the present expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sent his comrade off, William Howe, leaving his steeds quietly
      browsing by the wayside, bent his steps towards home. Susan advanced
      rapidly to meet him; and in a few seconds the brother and sister were in
      each other&rsquo;s arms; and, after most affectionate greetings, they sat down
      by mutual consent upon a piece of felled timber which lay upon the bank&mdash;the
      lane on one side being bounded by an old coppice&mdash;and began to ask
      each other the thousand questions so interesting to the children of one
      house who have been long parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom surely has the rough and rugged bark of an unhewed elm had the
      honour of supporting so perfect an exquisite. Jem Hathaway, the exciseman,
      had in nothing exaggerated the magnificence of our young Londoner. From
      shoes which looked as if they had come from Paris in the ambassador&rsquo;s bag,
      to the curled head and the whiskered and mustachio&rsquo;d countenance, (for the
      hat which should have been the crown of the finery was wanting&mdash;probably
      in consequence of the recent overturn,) from top to toe he looked fit for
      a ball at Almack&rsquo;s, or a fete at Bridgewater House; and, oh! how unsuited
      to the old-fashioned homestead at Rutherford West! His lower appointments,
      hose and trousers, were of the finest woven silk; his coat was claret
      colour, of the latest cut; his waistcoat&mdash;talk of the great peacock,
      <i>he</i> would have seemed dingy and dusky beside such a splendour of
      colour!&mdash;his waistcoat literally dazzled poor Susan&rsquo;s eyes; and his
      rings, and chains, and studs, and brooches, seemed to the wondering girl
      almost sufficient to stock a jeweller&rsquo;s shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all this nonsense, it was clear to her from every look and
      word that she was not mistaken in believing William unchanged in mind and
      disposition, and that there was a warm and a kind heart beating under the
      finery. Moreover, she felt that if the unseemly magnificence could once be
      thrown aside, the whiskers and mustachios cleared away, and his fine manly
      person reinstated in the rustic costume in which she had been accustomed
      to see him, her brother would <i>then</i> appear greatly improved in face
      and figure, taller, more vigorous, and with an expression of intelligence
      and frankness delightful to behold. But how to get quit of the finery, and
      the Frenchman, and the britschka? Or how reconcile her father to
      iniquities so far surpassing even the smell of musk?
    </p>
    <p>
      William, on his part, regarded his sister with unqualified admiration. He
      had left a laughing blooming girl, he found a delicate and lovely young
      woman, all the more lovely for the tears that mingled with her smiles,
      true tokens of a most pure affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really are glad to see me, Susy? And my father is well? And here
      is the old place, looking just as it used to do; house, and ricks, and
      barnyard, not quite in sight, but one feels that one shall see them at the
      next turning&mdash;the great coppice right opposite, looking thicker and
      greener than ever! how often we have gone nutting in that coppice!&mdash;the
      tall holly at the gate, with the woodbine climbing up, and twisting its
      sweet garlands round the very topmost spray like a coronet;&mdash;many a
      time and often have I climbed the holly to twine the flaunting wreath
      round your straw-bonnet, Miss Susy! And here, on the other side of the
      hedge, is the very field where Hector and Harebell ran their famous
      course, and gave their hare fifty turns before they killed her, without
      ever letting her get out of the stubble. Those were pleasant days, Susan,
      after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy days, dear William!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall go nutting again, shall we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, dear brother! Only&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash; And
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what, Miss Susy?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only I don&rsquo;t see how you can possibly go into the copse in this dress.
      Think how the brambles would prick and tear, and how that chain would
      catch in the hazel stems! and as to climbing the holly-tree in that fine
      tight coat, or beating the stubbles for a hare in those delicate thin
      shoes, why the thing is out of the question. And I really don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo;
       continued Susan, finding it easier to go on than to begin, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t
      believe that either Hector or Harebell would know you if they saw you so
      decked out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William laughed outright
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to go coursing in these shoes, I assure you, Susy. This is
      an evening dress. I have a shooting-jacket and all thereunto belonging in
      the britschka, which will not puzzle either Harebell or Hector, because
      it&rsquo;s just what they have been used to see me wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it on, then, I beseech you?&rdquo; exclaimed Susy; &ldquo;put it on directly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am not going coursing this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but my father!&mdash;Oh, dear William! if you did but know how
      he hates finery, and foreigners, and whiskers, and britschkas! Oh, dear
      William, send off the French gentleman and the outlandish carriage&mdash;run
      into the coppice and put on the shooting-dress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Susan!&rdquo; began William; but Susan having once summoned up courage
      sufficient to put her remonstrances into words, followed up the attack
      with an earnestness that did not admit a moment&rsquo;s interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father hates finery even more than Harebell or Hector would do. You
      know his country notions, dear William; and I think that latterly he has
      hated everything that looks Londonish and new-fangled worse than ever. We
      are old-fashioned people at Rutherford. There&rsquo;s your pretty old friend
      Mary Amott can&rsquo;t abide gewgaws any more than my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Arnott! You mean Mrs. Giles. What do I care for her likes and
      dislikes?&rdquo; exclaimed William, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Mary Arnott, and not Mrs. Giles, and you do care for her likes and
      dislikes a great deal,&rdquo; replied his sister, with some archness. &ldquo;Poor
      Mary, when the week before that fixed for the wedding arrived, felt that
      she <i>could</i> not marry Master Jacob Giles; so she found an opportunity
      of speaking to him alone, and told him the truth. I even believe, although
      I have no warrant for saying so, that she confessed she could not love him
      because she loved another. Master Giles behaved like a wise man, and told
      her father that it would be very wrong to force her inclinations. He
      behaved kindly as well as wisely, for he endeavoured to reconcile all
      parties, and put matters in train for the wedding that had hindered his.
      This at that time Master Arnott would not hear of, and therefore we did
      not tell you that the marriage which you took for granted had gone off.
      Till about three months ago, that odious lawsuit was in full action, and
      Master Arnott as violently set against my father as ever. Then, however,
      he was taken ill, and, upon his deathbed, he sent for his old friend,
      begged his pardon, and appointed him guardian to Mary. And there she is at
      home&mdash;for she would not come to meet you&mdash;but there she is,
      hoping to find you just what you were when you went away, and hating
      Frenchmen, and britschkas, and finery, and the smell of musk, just as if
      she were my father&rsquo;s daughter in good earnest. And now, dear William, I
      know what has been passing in your mind, quite as well as if hearts were
      peep-shows, and one could see to the bottom of them at the rate of a penny
      a look. I know that you went away for love of Mary, and flung yourself
      into the finery of London to try to get rid of the thought of her, and
      came down with all this nonsense of britschkas, and whiskers, and
      waistcoats, and rings, just to show her what a beau she had lost in losing
      you&mdash;Did not you, now? Well! don&rsquo;t stand squeezing my hand, but go
      and meet your French friend, who has got a man, I see, to help to pick up
      the fallen equipage. Go and get rid of him,&rdquo; quoth Susan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; exclaimed William, in laughing perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him the britschka!&rdquo; responded his sister, &ldquo;and send them off
      together as fast as may be. That will be a magnificent farewell. And then
      take your portmanteau into the copse, and change all this trumpery for the
      shooting-jacket and its belongings; and then come back and let me trim
      these whiskers as closely as scissors can trim them, and then we&rsquo;ll go to
      the farm, to gladden the hearts of Harebell, Hector, my dear father, and&mdash;somebody
      else; and it will not be that somebody&rsquo;s fault if ever you go to London
      again, or get into a britschka, or put on a chain, or a ring, or write
      with blue ink upon pink paper, as long as you live. Now go and dismiss the
      Frenchman,&rdquo; added Susan, laughing, &ldquo;and well walk home together the
      happiest brother and sister in Christendom.&rdquo;
